Also, very few places for coffee, only a couple where you can sit down but not easy to find. Best cafes are five minutes away towards Victoria or Trafalgar but quite full most of the time. The London eye is near over the bridge and on the way you can see the London Aquarium, my kids loved it. Also, its an easy walk to St James park and Buckingham Palace.

The Ferris wheel cabins don't even stop completely for visitors to enter, but they move very slowly, you almost don't even feel them moving. 25 people can fit inside each capsule, which is air-conditioned.\n\nThere is a bench in the middle, but as the ride is short, I recommend standing, moving around the cabin to see the view from all angles.\n\nIt was so much fun!!!",

My main tip is don't rush through, take your time and enjoy it. Was able to get some amazing pictures (Galaxy S20).\n\nThe VR experience was actually pretty good - better than the one I went to in Seaworld in San Diego. It was £9 per person, or £14 for two, on the day. Not sure if it's actually cheaper for two to buy in advance.\n\nDefinitely cheapest to buy entry tickets more than two or three days in advance, they go up closer to the day. It is a pricey day out though. In the end we benefited from having anytime tickets, but if your travel plans are fairly set, they'd work too.\n\nPlan to eat either before or after as there were only snacks in a vending machine inside. Also, use the bathrooms near the jellyfish if you need to as once you exit the shop there are no more bathrooms.",

The seats were incredibly comfortable and the tickets included two drinks tickets, a program and a little booklet, all lovely touches.\n\nThe cast was outstanding, and I loved the performances of the lawyers in particular, although everyone was brilliant. The play is a typical Agatha Christie who dun it, which I love and is why we went. A thoroughly enjoyable time in a really unique and historical setting.\n\nBeing on the jury was fantastic too, with fun touches like swearing in, having the lawyers greet you as they come in, and actors often speaking directly to you. You write down the verdict and feel very much part of the performance.\n\nMy only complaint is that when the show ended, we were immediately being rushed out of the room. My sister has gone to the bathroom and I was asked to carry her stuff out of the room, even though she'd only be a few minutes. Given we were finishing our drinks that came with some expensive tickets, it ruined the vibe a little bit. I wonder if keeping the room open for a simple ten minutes would help, as we definitely weren't the only ones rushed out, and I heard similar complaints. A shame, as the evening was otherwise stellar!",

We asked if they had room for two. The first level was completely full so she ran upstairs to check. At first I didn't understand if it was okay for us to go up or if we had to wait. Then she saw we hadn't gone up and motioned us up but again she seemed kind of irritated.\nUpstairs we were seated and placed our order. The food was okay. The fish had a good crisp but the meat inside didn't have much flavor. The fries were okay as well, some were kind of crispy, others kind of soft, but not in a very yummy way, the inside felt kind of dry. Also, I guess having peas on the side is common in England but I didn't love the combination. I didn't mind that much though, it was just the fish and chips weren't amazing. When we got our food, my husband's drink order still hadn't arrived. We asked one of the employees and she brought it by soon after. The ambience here is pretty loud. The people downstairs were cheery and chatty and you can hear it all clearly from upstairs which was fine with me. Overall, the service was kind of slow and not friendly and the food was just okay.

So if you need to take a rest for your legs after a long day and have some peace of mind, this is a nice place. Regarding the food, i had the prawn toast which was nice. But the sirloin steak was bit too hard even though i ordered medium rare and the sauce accompanied the steak was quite a small portion. However the servers were very friendly. And the vegetables were really tasty. They're very nice and accommodating to replace the chips with broccoli for me. Also, the wine list is extensive. Would be back again.",
